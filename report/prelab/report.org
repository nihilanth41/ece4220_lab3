Flowchart for week 2.
** In the prelab you should include the definitions for the following terms:
*** Shortest job first
Priority based scheduling with priorities ranked based on their execution time. 
*** First come first served
Schedules jobs in order of their arrival time. (FIFO) 
*** Foreground-background
Schedules a newly ready job immediately for a fixed time. If the job isn't
complete it gets added to the end of a queue which uses strictly round-robin
scheduling.
*** Round robin
All tasks have equal priority. Tasks are alloted a fixed amount of time in which
to execute called a quantum. If the task is still not complete it gets moved to
the end of the queue and the task at the beginning of the queue is scheduled.
*** Polled scheduling
Polls the task constantly to find when it is done. Foreground-background with no foreground. 
*** Priority based scheduling
Assigns priority to incoming tasks and schedules based on highest priority. 
High priority tasks can preeempt lower priorities.
*** Priority inversion
When a high priority task is indirectly preempted by a lower priority task.
*** Starvation
When a process is continually denied the resources needed to finish its work. 
E.g. constantly being preempted. 
** Furthermore, you should investigate RTAI functions to initialize and signal semaphores in Kernel Space:
*** rt_sem_init
*** rt_sem_delete
*** rt_sem_wait
*** rt_sem_signal
** And the following functions: 
*** rt_sleep 
*** rt_busy_sleep
