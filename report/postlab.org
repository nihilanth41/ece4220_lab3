* Lab 3 Report
** Objectives
The main objectives for Lab 3 were to learn about different scheduling
algorithms, the problems associated with each, and the concepts of priority
inversion, task starvation, etc.
*** Lab Description
The specific objectives of Lab 3 were:
1. Implement a traffic-light type system using the RTAI libraries
2. Observe the behavior of the traffic light system with various different task priorities.
** Implementation
The implementation for part 1 and 2 are very similar. In both cases the goal is
to setup a traffic-light system which will allow traffic to flow one way at a
time, and allow pedestrians to cross when requested (by pressing a button.)

In part one, the system is implemented using a single real time task and a
polling based scheduler is used to determine when to turn lights on and off.
This is essentially the same behavior as the priority based scheduler used
in part 2, with all priorities set to the same value.

In part two, the traffic-light system is implemented using three distinct real
time tasks. Each task is assigned a priority, and different combinations of
priorities are tested in order to determine how the system behaves in each
case. Because there are multiple tasks fighting for control of the same
resource (the memory associated with the DDR, and DR registers), a binary
semaphore is used
